# Simple-Neural-Network-with-Numpy

I am reimplementing a simple neural network from a blog post using Toy Dataset. The only dependency needed for this project is Numpy. This
is very good for those who has jsut started to enter the world of Artificial Intelligence. By rebuilding the network from memory, i was 
able to understand the basic of neural networks such as activation function, weights updating, and forward computation.
